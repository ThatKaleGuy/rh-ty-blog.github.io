# Title

Im not sure what to write for this to be completely honest i just dont want to leave it blank. Text seems to render the same as discord text so formatting the individual words should be simple enough, surrounding a word with a single asterisk on each side for italic, two asterisks on either side for bold, a hashtag/pound sign and a space for increased font size/title label, etcetera. Yesterday was fun, the mario kart tournament was good, the mr potato head thing was a little odd but enjoyable and the cup towers were great even if they turned into what looks like a group of cult shrines. Kinda wish i could be playing the new Risk Of Rain 2 DLC but my pc is in galway, kinda cruel that theyve got images of ROR2 drones especially on the monitor at the top

I enjoyed yesterday, i managed to code a deck of cards, its absolutely scuffed, essentially being a random number generator and 52 if statements in a row but it works so im quite happy with it, im looking forward to the engineering task later on at 14:00 so that should be fun

Yesterday was fun, we got to learn about the Bash language which was a lot harder to grasp than Python but it was nice to be able to see the actual differences between the two and kind of get a feel for just how different two coding languages can be even if theyre just doing the same thing, i enjoyed it quite a lot. There was a presentation on the history of cloud computing which was fun as well, i enjoyed learning about it because its kind of something i dont really tend to think about, just use because its just a sort of constant in modern living so actually getting to see what goes into it was nice. At the end of the day we had an engineering task to try and build a rollercoaster out of paper straws and tape, it was quite difficult but it was fun to try and organise building something like that with a group of people as opposed to just trying to build it on our own.
