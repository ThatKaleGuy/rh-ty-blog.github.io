# Title 
Im not sure what to write for this to be completely honest i just dont want to leave it blank. Text seems to render the same as discord text so formatting the individual words should be simple enough, surrounding a word with a single asterisk on each side for italic, two asterisks on either side for bold, a hashtag/pound sign and a space for increased font size/title label, etcetera. Yesterday was fun, the mario kart tournament was good, the mr potato head thing was a little odd but enjoyable and the cup towers were great even if they turned into what looks like a group of cult shrines. I miss Jess. Kinda wish i could be playing the new Risk Of Rain 2 DLC but my pc is in galway, kinda cruel that theyve got images of ROR2 drones especially on the monitor at the top

I successfully* coded a deck of cards, kinda? I essentially made a random number generator between 1 and 52 with each number being assigned a card from a standard 52 card deck, but it does in fact spit out a random card every time, i want to make it so that it logs what cards have been pulled and prevents them form being pulled a second time, my idea was to replicate the game 21, and have an ai be the opponent but i have literally no idea how id go about doing that so as of right now this will do. In total i think the thing took up over 60 lines of code purely because it had 52 lines of something like "if value == 1: print("Ace of Spaces") over and over till i got every card in a deck. I wish i knew how to export this code or even just copy paste it so that i could work on it at home but i dont so bleh
